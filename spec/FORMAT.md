# DarkProof wire format (v0.4, marker byte 0xB2)

The Android and iPhone apps must produce and accept exactly these bytes.
`test-vectors.txt` holds byte-exact examples; both apps' unit tests check against it.
The app was called Blackout before. Protocol constants such as `blackout-mesh-v1`, `blackout-public`, `blackout-mesh` and `it.blackout.mesh.v1` keep that name on purpose: changing them would break every existing group and device.

## Packet

All integers are big-endian.

| Offset | Size | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | marker | `0xB2`. Anything else is dropped. |
| 1 | 8 | id | Random. Written as 16 lowercase hex chars wherever it is used as text. |
| 9 | 8 | ts | Sender's clock, milliseconds since 1970-01-01 UTC, signed 64-bit. |
| 17 | 1 | ttl | Hops left, 0–64. Packets with ttl > 64 are dropped. |
| 18 | n | cipher | 1–16000 bytes. See below. |

Relays read only id, ts and ttl.

## Encryption

- **Key:** PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, 120000 iterations, 32-byte output.
  - Password: the group code, NFC-normalized, as UTF-8 bytes.
  - Salt: the ASCII bytes of `blackout-mesh-v1`.
- **Cipher:** AES-256-GCM with a 12-byte random IV and a 16-byte tag.
  - Associated data: the UTF-8 bytes of `<id hex>|<ts decimal>`, for example `0123456789abcdef|1793807238631`.
  - `cipher` = IV (12) ‖ ciphertext ‖ tag (16).
- **Plaintext:** three text fields in this order:
  1. `sender`: the device id.
  2. `name`: the display name.
  3. `text`: the message.
- **Text field:** a 2-byte length followed by that many bytes of standard UTF-8. Do not use Java's modified UTF-8.
- Readers ignore bytes after the third field, which leaves room for future fields.

A packet that fails to decrypt is still stored and forwarded. It just isn't shown.

## Groups and the Public channel

- **Every DarkProof device relays for every other.** Devices connect to any DarkProof device they find, whatever its group, and forward all packets. A group exists only through its code: only members can decrypt its messages.
- **Public channel:** messages sealed with the code `blackout-public`, which everyone knows. Anyone can read and post them, including people without the app through the Wi-Fi board (Android). Apps show them marked as public.
- **Reading:** a device tries its own group's key first, then the public key. A packet that opens with neither is relayed but not shown.

## Invites

An invite link carries a group's name and code so nobody has to type the code:

```
darkproof://join?name=<group name>&code=<group code>
```

- Both values are URL-encoded query items. `code` has at least 8 characters. `name` is only a label shown on screen; it is not used for encryption, and a missing name means "Group".
- Apps show the link as a QR code and can send it any way the phone can share a link, such as AirDrop.
- New groups get a random code of 16 characters from `ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789`, in four groups of four joined by `-` (80 bits of entropy).
- Anyone with the link can read the group, exactly like anyone who knows the code.

## Check-ins

A check-in is an ordinary group message, so apps that don't know check-ins still show it as text:

- `✅ I'm safe` means safe. Any message whose text starts with `✅` counts as "safe".
- `🆘 I need help` means needs help. Any message whose text starts with `🆘` counts as "needs help".

A check-in may end with ` · 🔋 NN%`: the sender's battery level (0 to 100) when they sent it, for example
`✅ I'm safe · 🔋 23%`. Apps read the last `🔋 ` in a check-in, followed by 1 to 3 ASCII digits and `%`; anything
else means no battery level. Apps that don't know it just show the text.

A person's status is their most recent check-in, and so is their battery level.

## Forwarding rules

- **Flooding:** each packet goes to every connected peer except the one it came from.
- **Deduplication:** a packet whose id has already been seen is ignored.
- **TTL:** forwarded copies carry `ttl - 1`, and only if the received ttl is greater than 1. New messages start at ttl 16.
- **Storage:** up to 500 packets, kept for at most 7 days. All stored packets are sent to every newly connected peer.

## Transports

| Transport | Framing |
|---|---|
| Nearby Connections (Android only) | Service id `it.blackout.mesh.v1`, strategy `P2P_CLUSTER`. One `BYTES` payload per packet. |
| LAN test mode (debug builds) | 4-byte length, then the packet. |
| LoRa via Meshtastic | The packet is `Data.payload` on port 256 (`PRIVATE_APP`), broadcast on channel 0 with hop limit 3. The whole packet must be ≤ 233 bytes. |
| Bluetooth LE (Android and iPhone) | See below. |
| Apple peer-to-peer (iPhone only) | MultipeerConnectivity. Each packet is one `.reliable` message. See below. |

## Bluetooth LE

This is the only radio link both platforms share without a router. Android phones also keep Nearby. Duplicate packets arriving over both are dropped by the forwarding rules.

### Roles

Every device is a **peripheral**: it advertises and runs a GATT server. It is also a **central**: it scans and connects.

An iPhone in the background advertises in a way Android cannot see. It can still scan and connect out to Android phones, which always advertise.

### Service UUID

`bec33cd5-a64e-4e1a-b8c1-868db67d0df3`, the same for every DarkProof device (see "Groups and the Public channel").

- **Advertisement:** connectable. It contains only this 128-bit service UUID, with no device name.

### Characteristics

| Name | UUID | Properties | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| RX | `33826aba-0bb0-4dfe-9c1a-86e48726ed62` | write (with response) | central → peripheral |
| TX | `94eb2c34-0e66-4bea-864c-d02a7694a3d5` | notify, with a CCCD descriptor | peripheral → central |

### Connection setup

1. The central connects.
2. It requests the largest ATT MTU and discovers the service.
3. It enables notifications on TX by writing `01 00` to its CCCD.
4. The link is then open in both directions.

### Frames

Each direction carries a stream of frames:

`type` (1 byte) ‖ `length` (2 bytes, big-endian) ‖ `payload` (`length` bytes).

**Chunking:**
- The stream is cut into chunks of at most min(ATT_MTU − 3, 512) bytes. 512 is the longest attribute value BLE allows; Android throws an error above it.
- Each chunk is one write (central → peripheral) or one notification (peripheral → central). Long or prepared writes are not used.
- A side sends its next chunk only after the previous one completes. For the central, that is the write response. For the peripheral, that is the notification-sent callback.

**Frame types:**

| Type | Name | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | HELLO | Version byte `1`, then the node id: printable ASCII, 1–64 bytes. |
| 2 | PACKET | One packet (see above), up to 18 + 16000 bytes. |

- Each side sends HELLO as its first frame, as soon as it can send. For the central, that is after its CCCD write completes. For the peripheral, that is when notifications get enabled.
- PACKET frames received before the other side's HELLO are ignored.
- An unknown type, a version other than 1, or a bad length means: disconnect.
- After both HELLOs, each side treats the link as a neighbor in the forwarding rules. That includes sending it all stored packets.

### Duplicate links

Two devices may connect to each other twice, once in each direction. When a device sees a second link to a node id it already has a link with, it keeps only one:
- Keep the link whose central has the smaller node id, comparing bytes.
- If both links have the same central, keep the newer one.

Both sides reach the same decision. Either side may close the other link.

## History

- `0xB1`, v0.2: text fields used Java's modified UTF-8, and the code was not normalized.
- `0xB2`, v0.3: standard UTF-8, NFC-normalized group code.
- `0xB2`, v0.4: same packets. Discovery no longer depends on the group code (one Bluetooth LE service UUID, one Nearby service id, no Multipeer group filter), and the Public channel was added. v0.3 and v0.4 devices do not find each other.

## Apple peer-to-peer (iPhone to iPhone)

iPhones also connect to each other with MultipeerConnectivity, which uses Bluetooth and Apple's peer-to-peer Wi-Fi. Android cannot join these connections.

- **Service type:** `blackout-mesh`. It is listed in the app's `NSBonjourServices`.
- **Peer display name:** the node id.
- **Discovery info:** `v` = `1`. Peers without it are ignored.
- **Who invites:** the device with the smaller node id. The invitation context is the UTF-8 bytes of `blackout-mesh-v1`, and invitations with a different context are declined.
- **Messages:** each packet is sent as one `.reliable` message.
